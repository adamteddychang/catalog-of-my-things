# Catalog Of My Things 

> This is the Ruby capstone group project, in this project we created a console app with an user interface.

> The app allows you to add items of your choice, i.e. books or music albums, and it will also allow you to create a label or genre for said item. 

> The application preserves user data by using JSON files while exiting the application. 

> It will load data from the JSON files while starting up the application.
